# ARC 3 — SCT-F → CI Formal Coupling  
## Why Computable Institutions Are Structurally Necessary

---

## Position in the Arc

This file establishes the formal coupling between:

- **ARC 2:** Social Coordination Theory – Flow (SCT-F)
- **ARC 3:** Computable Institutions (CI)

It answers a single question:

> Why must institutions become computable under trust-minimal conditions?

---

## SCT-F Recap (Constraint, Not Preference)

From ARC 2, we established:

1. Trust decays with scale, time, and heterogeneity
2. Discretion expands as trust declines
3. Discretion introduces:
   - ambiguity
   - selective enforcement
   - narrative reconciliation
4. These dynamics produce **coordination drift**, not episodic failure

This is not a moral claim.  
It is a **structural constraint**.

## The Trust-Minimal Coordination Problem

Under trust-minimal conditions:

- Actors cannot assume:
  - good faith
  - shared interpretation
  - stable memory
- Any coordination mechanism that depends on:
  - interpretation
  - judgment
  - exception handling
  - human arbitration

will eventually diverge.

This includes:
- contracts
- audits
- committees
- procedural compliance systems

---

## Why Traditional Institutions Fail Here

Traditional institutions rely on:

- narrative reconciliation (“what really happened”)
- discretionary enforcement
- post-hoc interpretation
- authority-based resolution

Under SCT-F conditions:
- narratives conflict
- authority is contested
- memory is rewritten
- enforcement becomes selective

This is **not corruption by intent**.  
It is **corruption by structure**.

---

## The CI Necessity Claim

A **Computable Institution (CI)** is defined by:

> Institutional facts that are determined by execution, not interpretation.

CI satisfies SCT-F constraints because it:

- removes discretion at execution time
- makes outcomes rule-determined
- produces verifiable state transitions
- allows replay without trust

Therefore:

> **CI is the minimal institutional form that remains stable under trust-minimal coordination.**

CI is not an optimization.  
CI is **structurally implied** by SCT-F.

---

## Formal Coupling Statement

We can now state the coupling precisely:

> If coordination must operate under trust-minimal conditions (SCT-F),  
> then institutional facts must be computable (CI),  
> otherwise coordination drift is unavoidable.

This is a necessity claim, not a design choice.

---

## What CI Does *Not* Solve (Boundary)

CI does not:
- guarantee justice
- eliminate conflict
- enforce morality
- prevent bad incentives

CI only guarantees this:

> **Given agreed rules, institutional reality is determined by execution, not trust.**

That is sufficient for coordination stability.

---

## Transition Forward

With CI established as necessary, the next questions are:

1. How does CI become executable? → **ENI**
2. How are rules executed without discretion? → **SFEU**
3. How is institutional memory preserved across time? → **TDV**
4. How does this form a full institution? → **DNI**

These are addressed in the next ARC 3 files.
