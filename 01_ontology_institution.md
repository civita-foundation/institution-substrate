# ARC 1 — Ontology  
## What an Institution *Is*

---

## Why Ontology Comes First

Most failures in institutional reform do not come from bad execution.  
They come from **ontological confusion**.

People argue about:
- governance models
- incentives
- technology
- culture

while disagreeing—often implicitly—about **what an institution actually is**.

This file fixes that.

## Minimal Ontological Definition

> **An institution is a stable pattern of coordination that persists beyond individual actors.**

Key properties embedded in this definition:
- **Patterned** (not ad hoc)
- **Coordinative** (not merely descriptive)
- **Persistent** (survives personnel change)
- **Supra-individual** (not reducible to any one human)

If any of these properties are absent, what you have is *not* an institution.

---

## What an Institution Is *Not*

An institution is **not**:
- an organization
- a legal entity
- a building
- a culture
- a policy
- a leader
- a document
- a belief

These may be **carriers** or **interfaces**, but not the institution itself.

Mistaking carriers for institutions is the most common category error.

---

## Institutions vs Organizations

| Concept | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Institution | Abstract coordination pattern |
| Organization | A concrete instantiation of one or more institutions |

Organizations can die.  
Institutions persist.

Example:
- A company fails → the *corporate form* persists.
- A government collapses → *governance patterns* re-emerge.

---

## Institutions as Constraint Systems

Institutions exist to **constrain behavior** in order to enable coordination.

Without constraint:
- trust collapses
- predictability disappears
- scale becomes impossible

Constraint is not oppression.  
Constraint is the *price of coordination*.

---

## Status Functions (Foundational)

Following (but extending) Searle:

> An institution assigns **status functions**:  
> *“X counts as Y in context C.”*

Examples:
- Paper counts as money
- A person counts as a judge
- A digital signature counts as authorization

But this project goes further:

**Status functions must be executable or they decay.**

## The Three Ontological Layers of an Institution

Every institution contains three layers, whether explicit or implicit:

### 1. Symbolic Layer
- Language
- Titles
- Laws
- Documents
- Narratives

Necessary, but insufficient.

---

### 2. Constraint Layer
- What actions are allowed
- What actions are forbidden
- What actions are ambiguous
- What actions are unenforceable

This layer determines **real behavior**.

---

### 3. Execution Layer
- Who enforces
- How enforcement happens
- What happens on violation
- What happens on ambiguity

Institutions fail when this layer is undefined or overloaded.

---

## Persistence Through Time (Critical)

Institutions must survive:
- leadership change
- personnel turnover
- memory loss
- political shifts

Therefore:

> **Institutions are time-bearing entities.**

Any theory that ignores time is incomplete.

(Time will be formalized later via TDV, but ontologically it already exists here.)

---

## Trust as an Emergent Property

Trust is **not** a moral quality.  
Trust is **not** goodwill.

> **Trust emerges when constraints and execution are predictable.**

Trust collapses when:
- discretion exceeds observability
- enforcement is inconsistent
- memory is lost
- rules are symbolic but not executable

This leads directly to SCT-F later.

---

## Institutions Are Not Optimizers

Institutions do **not** maximize outcomes.

They:
- reduce uncertainty
- bound behavior
- make coordination *possible*

Optimization comes later—if at all.

Expecting institutions to optimize is a category error.

---

## Ontological Failure Modes

An institution becomes unstable when:

1. Symbolic layer grows faster than execution
2. Constraints exceed enforcement capacity
3. Discretion expands without observability
4. Memory is externalized to individuals
5. Time is ignored (no continuity model)

These are *structural*, not moral failures.

---

## Ontological Test (Quick Check)

Ask:

1. What pattern persists if everyone leaves?
2. What constrains behavior when nobody is watching?
3. What executes decisions when discretion fails?
4. What remembers past actions?
5. What survives leadership change?

If you cannot answer these, the “institution” is ill-defined.

---

## What Comes Next

Now that we know **what an institution is**, we must define:

- what makes it *feasible*
- where it breaks
- how trust collapses structurally

This leads to **SCT-F**.
