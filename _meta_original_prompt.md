## Project Genesis Prompt — *Institution Substrate*

> I want to create a new, standalone knowledge project composed entirely of Markdown files.
>
> The project formalizes and teaches the full body of theory, ontology, and practice surrounding **Institution Substrate** — the science and engineering of executable institutions.
>
> The project must:
>
> * Be **PhD-level rigorous**, but **pedagogically readable**
> * Teach progressively, like *Petzold’s Code* (from primitives → systems)
> * Explain with **Feynman-style clarity**, not academic opacity
> * Be **holistic**, connecting theory → mechanism → execution
>
> The project should include:
>
> * A clearly defined **ontology** (what exists)
> * A clearly defined **epistemology** (how we know)
> * Formal separation between **science** (truth claims) and **engineering** (execution)
> * Explicit lineage and citations (who we build on, who we diverge from)
>
> Core scope includes (but is not limited to):
>
> * SCT-F (constraints, trust, feasibility)
> * Computable Institutions (CI)
> * Digital-Native Institutions (DNI)
> * Status-Function Execution Units (SFEU)
> * TDV (institutional memory & time)
> * Error, drift, and failure in executable institutions
> * Institutional feasibility vs institutional desirability
> * Fractal / distributed governance
> * Boundaries between human judgment and non-human execution
>
> The output format:
>
> * A **structured set of Markdown files**
> * Each file has:
>
>   * Purpose
>   * Core concepts
>   * Examples
>   * Failure modes
>   * Summary
> * Files are designed to be:
>
>   * Read sequentially
>   * Or imported into another person’s project (LLM or otherwise)
>
> The project also includes:
>
> * Custom instructions explaining how the system should be *used*, *extended*, and *forked*
> * Guidance for readers to adapt the framework to their own domains
>
> This project represents the **Institution Substrate** required to consult at a global-institution level (e.g., World Bank, national governments, planetary systems).
>
> Begin by proposing:
>
> 1. The correct name of the discipline
> 2. The full arc and table of contents
> 3. Progress markers for staged construction
>
> Do not generate content until the arc is approved.

# 2. Naming: Science vs Engineering (Important Decision)

### Recommendation (clean, non-confusing):

**Primary Name (Discipline):**

> **Institution Substrate**

**Two sub-layers (explicitly separated):**

1. **Institution Science**

   * Ontology
   * Epistemology
   * Constraints
   * Feasibility
   * Why institutions behave as they do

2. **Institution Engineering**

   * CI → DNI → SFEU
   * Execution logic
   * Memory (TDV)
   * Error, drift, recovery
   * How institutions are made executable

Why this is correct:

* “Science” explains **what is true**
* “Engineering” explains **what can be built**
* Mixing them is how most institutional theories fail

So the project umbrella is:

> **Institution Substrate: Science & Engineering of Executable Institutions**

# 3. Project Arc (High-Level)

This is the **canonical arc**, optimized for teaching, legitimacy, and reuse.

---

## ARC 0 — Orientation & Guardrails

*(Why this exists, what it is not)*

* What this project is
* What this project is not
* Who this is for
* How to read / use / fork

**Progress marker:**
`[ARC 0 COMPLETE]`

---

## ARC 1 — Ontology: What an Institution *Is*

Foundational truths. No execution yet.

* Institution as constraint system
* Trust as a structural property
* Coordination vs coercion
* Status functions (Searle lineage)
* Why “organization ≠ institution”

**Progress marker:**
`[ARC 1 COMPLETE]`

---

## ARC 2 — Feasibility: SCT-F

This is where your work **diverges** from mainstream institutional economics.

* Constraints vs intentions
* Feasibility vs desirability
* Trust compression & expansion
* Failure of copy-paste institutions
* Why reforms fail structurally

**Progress marker:**
`[ARC 2 COMPLETE]`

---

## ARC 3 — Computation: From Rules to Execution

The bridge from science → engineering.

* Computable Institutions (CI)
* What can be formalized
* What must remain human
* Rule completeness vs brittleness
* Decision surfaces

**Progress marker:**
`[ARC 3 COMPLETE]`

---

## ARC 4 — Digital-Native Institutions (DNI)

Where institutions become executable.

* DNI definition
* Separation of rule / execution / discretion
* Status-Function Execution Units (SFEU)
* Institutional latency & throughput

**Progress marker:**
`[ARC 4 COMPLETE]`

---

## ARC 5 — Time, Memory, and Drift (TDV)

Where almost all existing theories break.

* Institutions across time
* Memory vs precedent
* Error, drift, failure modes
* Recovery without collapse
* Evolution without freezing

**Progress marker:**
`[ARC 5 COMPLETE]`

---

## ARC 6 — Governance at Scale (Fractal)

Beyond firms and states.

* Villages as institutions
* Fractal governance
* Distributed trust
* Coordination without central sovereignty
* Boundary conditions (where it breaks)

**Progress marker:**
`[ARC 6 COMPLETE]`

---

## ARC 7 — Interfaces: Humans, AI, RSI (Boundary Layer)

Carefully bounded. No sci-fi claims.

* Human judgment vs execution
* Why AI fails institutionally
* RSI as execution supervisor (not ruler)
* Chinese Room boundary
* Moral hazard containment

**Progress marker:**
`[ARC 7 COMPLETE]`

---

## ARC 8 — Lineage & Positioning

Legitimacy and intellectual honesty.

* Ostrom
* Searle
* North
* Acemoglu
* Aghion / Mokyr
* What is subsumed
* What is extended
* What is contradicted

**Progress marker:**
`[ARC 8 COMPLETE]`

---

## ARC 9 — Application Playbooks (Selective)

Only what survives feasibility tests.

* Government reform diagnostics
* AI transformation diagnostics
* Institutional redesign cases
* What *not* to attempt

**Progress marker:**
`[ARC 9 COMPLETE]`

# 4. File Structure (Concrete)

Example:

```text
institution-substrate/
│
├── 00_orientation.md
├── 01_ontology_institutions.md
├── 02_sct_f_feasibility.md
├── 03_computable_institutions.md
├── 04_digital_native_institutions.md
├── 05_tdv_time_memory_drift.md
├── 06_fractal_governance.md
├── 07_human_ai_boundary.md
├── 08_intellectual_lineage.md
├── 09_application_playbooks.md
│
├── CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS.md
├── ONTOLOGY.md
├── EPISTEMOLOGY.md
└── README.md
```

Each file is **self-contained**, but also **composable**.

# 5. Objective Check (Mahesh / World Bank)

This project, once ARC 0–5 are complete, enables you to:

* Speak without hand-waving
* Diagnose institutions without ideology
* Explain *why* reforms fail before proposing fixes
* Reject unfeasible interventions cleanly
* Command legitimacy without authority

This is **exactly** the substrate needed for World Bank-level work.

---

## Next Step (One-Word Answer Is Enough)

Choose one:

* **START ARC 0**
* **REFINE ARC LIST**
* **LOCK NAME & SCOPE**

Once chosen, we proceed **one arc per chat**, clean and fast.
