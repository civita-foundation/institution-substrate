# ARC 3 — ENI
## Execution-Native Infrastructure

---

## Why ENI Exists

CI defines what *can* be computed.  
DNI defines what *must* be executed.

But neither answers the critical question:

> **Where does institutional execution actually live, persist, and survive across time, scale, and attack?**

That role belongs to **Execution-Native Infrastructure (ENI)**.

Without ENI:
- SFEU collapses into abstract logic
- DNI degrades into “workflow software”
- TDV becomes an afterthought
- Institutions remain fragile, deniable, and rewriteable

---

## Definition (Precise)

**Execution-Native Infrastructure (ENI)** is the **minimal runtime substrate** that makes institutional execution:

- possible  
- deterministic  
- time-bound  
- observable  
- and durable  

**without reliance on discretionary human intervention.**

ENI is not an institution.  
ENI is not governance.  
ENI is not application logic.

ENI is the **ground condition** that allows execution-native institutions to exist at all.

---

## Fixed Position in the Ontology

**Non-negotiable hierarchy:**

```
CI ⊃ ENI ⊃ DNI
```


- **CI** — Ontology: what institutional facts *are*
- **ENI** — Runtime: how execution, time, and memory *exist*
- **DNI** — Institutions: rules that *execute* on ENI

Both **SFEU** and **TDV** require ENI.

---

## What ENI Is NOT

ENI is not:
- cloud infrastructure
- DevOps tooling
- application backends
- workflow engines
- blockchains (though it may use components)
- audit systems

Those solve **engineering problems**.

ENI solves an **ontological problem**:

> How institutional reality persists without trust.

---

## Core Responsibilities of ENI

ENI provides **four irreducible guarantees**.

### 1. Deterministic Execution Semantics

- Same state + same rule → same outcome
- No hidden discretion paths
- No silent overrides

This is what makes SFEUs meaningful rather than symbolic.

---

### 2. Explicit Time Semantics

- Institutional time is ordered, explicit, and non-erasable
- “When” is part of the institutional fact, not metadata

Without this:
- backdating
- delay-based corruption
- timeline manipulation

ENI makes **time an institutional primitive**.

---

### 3. Evidence Emission & Custody Hooks

- ENI defines how execution produces evidence
- ENI guarantees evidence cannot be silently dropped

This is the **precondition** for TDV:
- commitment semantics
- custody separation
- access traceability

---

### 4. Failure Visibility

- Failures are first-class outcomes
- Non-execution is detectable
- Gaps are signals, not ambiguities

ENI prevents institutional amnesia **by default**.

---

## ENI vs DNI (Critical Distinction)

| Aspect | ENI | DNI |
|---|---|---|
| Nature | Infrastructure | Institution |
| Role | Enables execution | Uses execution |
| Scope | Generic | Domain-specific |
| Authority | None | Institutional |
| Change cadence | Slow, foundational | Evolvable |

ENI never decides *what should happen*.  
It only ensures that **whatever is defined can execute—or fail explicitly**.

---

## ENI vs SFEU

- **SFEU** = what executes (status functions)
- **ENI** = where and how execution is possible

An SFEU without ENI is:
- ungrounded
- unverifiable
- temporally ambiguous

---

## ENI vs TDV

- **TDV** preserves institutional memory across time
- **ENI** defines the conditions that make memory trustworthy

TDV answers:
> “Can this be proven later?”

ENI answers:
> “Can this ever be denied, erased, or forged in the first place?”

---

## Failure Semantics (ENI-Level)

ENI-level failures include:
- execution suppression
- state divergence
- broken ordering guarantees
- missing commitments
- custody violations

These are **infrastructure failures**, not moral ones.

They signal:
- institutional risk
- governance debt
- attack surfaces

---

## Why ENI Is Usually Missing

Because ENI:
- removes informal power
- prevents quiet fixes
- exposes systemic weakness
- eliminates plausible deniability

Most institutions prefer flexibility over durability.

---

## ENI in One Sentence

> **ENI is the substrate that makes institutional execution real, time-bound, and inescapable.**

## Transition Forward

Next in ARC 3:
> **SFEU — Status Function Execution Units**  
How institutional facts execute on ENI.
