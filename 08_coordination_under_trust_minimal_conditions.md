## ARC 2.3 — Coordination Under Trust-Minimal Conditions

### How Systems Function When Trust Is Scarce

---

## The Problem Statement

Most institutional theory assumes:

* baseline trust
* social norms
* reputational memory

These assumptions **fail at scale**.

> **Modern institutions must coordinate even when trust ≈ 0.**

---

## Trust as a Coordination Subsidy

Trust:

* compresses rules
* tolerates discretion
* lowers verification cost

But trust is:

* finite
* exhaustible
* non-scalable

---

## Trust-Minimal Regime (Definition)

A trust-minimal regime has:

* low legitimacy
* heterogeneous actors
* asymmetric power
* weak shared history

This is the default for:

* large states
* global platforms
* post-crisis systems
* multi-stakeholder regimes

---

## What Fails First When Trust Declines

1. Discretion becomes suspicious
2. Interpretation becomes contested
3. Enforcement becomes politicized
4. Coordination slows or fragments
5. Defensive defection emerges

This behavior is **rational**, not pathological.

---

## Coordination Without Trust: Structural Requirements

A trust-minimal system must provide:

1. Predictability
2. Verifiability
3. Non-arbitrariness
4. Temporal persistence
5. Actor-independent execution

These are **structural**, not cultural.

---

## The Discretion Collapse Principle

> **Discretion and low trust are incompatible at scale.**

* Discretion requires trust
* Low trust demands determinism

Institutions that keep discretion under low trust:

* centralize coercion
* or collapse into gridlock

---

## Rule-Bound Coordination

Rule-bound coordination requires:

* explicit rules
* finite state transitions
* zero interpretive latitude at execution time

Debate occurs **before rule adoption**,
never during execution.

---

## Why Contracts Fail Under Low Trust

Contracts fail because:

* enforcement is delayed
* interpretation is disputed
* adjudication is discretionary
* memory is fragile

Contracts are promises.
Low-trust systems require **execution**.

---

## Coordination as State Transition

In trust-minimal regimes:

* every action must be derivable from:

  * inputs
  * rules
  * execution

If outcomes require intent interpretation:

> **Trust has been reintroduced implicitly.**

---

## Verification Imperative

Every coordinated action must be:

* provable
* reconstructible
* checkable by third parties

If verification depends on:

* authority
* testimony
* narrative

Then coordination is not trust-minimal.

---

## Cost Tradeoff

Trust-minimal coordination increases:

* upfront rule design cost
* rigidity

But reduces:

* long-term enforcement cost
* corruption
* collapse risk

This is structural economics, not ideology.

---

## SCT-F Interpretation

In trust-minimal regimes:

* Trust Deficit ≈ 1
* Complexity Cost dominates feasibility

Therefore:

> **Feasibility depends on compressing coordination cost, not expanding surplus.**

This directly motivates **ENI**.

**Energy Dependency (ARC-E):**  
Low-trust coordination increases energy dissipation per interaction, raising the minimum energy threshold required for stable collective action.

---

## ENI Linkage (Critical)

Trust-minimal coordination **cannot** be sustained by:

* policy
* contracts
* norms

It requires:

> **Execution-Native Infrastructure (ENI)**

ENI provides:

* deterministic execution
* rule-bound state transitions
* verifiable outcomes independent of trust

ENI is the **runtime substrate** that replaces trust.

---

## Transition

We now have:

* why trust decays
* why corruption stabilizes
* why coordination fails without structure

Next:
→ **ARC 3 — Computable Institutions (CI)**
Formalizing institutions as executable systems.
