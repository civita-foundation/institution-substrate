# ARC 3 — TDV
## Temporal Data Verifiability Layer

---

## Fixed Context (Assumed)

- **Hierarchy:** CI ⊃ ENI ⊃ DNI
- **ENI:** execution-native infrastructure providing time, execution, and custody semantics
- **SFEU:** execution-only, rule-bound, non-interpretive units operating on ENI
- **DNI:** institutions whose constitutive rules execute via SFEUs on ENI
- **CI:** meta-class defining computable institutional facts

This file defines **TDV** precisely within that frame.

---

## Definition (Precise)

The **Temporal Data Verifiability Layer (TDV)** is the **evidence persistence and custody layer** that ensures institutional execution remains **verifiable across time without reliance on trust** in the institution, its operators, or its narrative.

TDV does not store “data” in the general sense.  
TDV preserves **institutional reality**.

TDV is **constitutive infrastructure**, not a feature.

---

## What TDV Is Not (Hard Boundaries)

TDV does **not**:
- interpret data
- decide outcomes
- enforce rules
- judge correctness
- execute status functions
- participate in governance
- expose institutional data by default

TDV is **amoral, non-discretionary, non-interpretive**.

---

## Ontological Role

ENI answers:
> *Can execution occur deterministically in time?*

SFEU answers:
> *What happened according to the rules?*

TDV answers:
> **Can what happened still be proven later—without trusting anyone?**

Without TDV:
- execution can be denied
- timelines can be rewritten
- logs can be erased
- accountability collapses into narrative disputes

TDV exists to **prevent institutional amnesia**.

---

## Relationship to ENI (Critical)

TDV **depends on ENI**.

ENI provides:
- execution ordering
- time semantics
- commitment guarantees
- custody primitives

TDV:
- binds evidence to ENI time
- preserves execution traces
- maintains verifiability across institutional change

TDV does **not** create time.  
TDV **anchors memory to time created by ENI**.

---

## SFEU vs TDV

**SFEU**
- executes rules
- produces state transitions
- generates execution traces
- present-tense

**TDV**
- receives execution traces or commitments
- preserves them immutably
- maintains custody guarantees
- cross-temporal

**SFEU = execution**  
**TDV = memory**

TDV never validates execution logic.  
It only preserves **evidence that execution occurred**.

---

## TDV and DNI

A **DNI** requires:
- rule-bound execution (SFEU)
- deterministic runtime (ENI)

But without TDV:
- execution may be correct
- yet unverifiable later

A DNI without TDV is **execution-complete but epistemically fragile**.

TDV makes DNI **institutionally durable**.

---

## TDV and CI

- **CI** defines what institutional facts *are computable*
- **TDV** makes those facts *falsifiable in reality*

Without TDV:
- CI remains theoretically sound
- but empirically contestable

TDV is what turns CI from theory into **testable institutional reality**.

---

## Non-Negotiable Properties

A system qualifies as TDV **only if all hold**:

1. **Immutability**  
   Evidence cannot be altered without detection.
2. **Custody Separation**  
   The institution recorded cannot unilaterally erase or modify evidence.
3. **Access Traceability**  
   Every access is itself recorded as evidence.
4. **Verification Independence**  
   Proof does not depend on trusting the TDV operator.
5. **Temporal Persistence**  
   Institutional memory survives personnel, political, and system change.

Fail any → **not TDV**.

---

## Failure Semantics (TDV Scope)

TDV does not prevent corruption.

It ensures corruption **cannot erase reality**.

Failure manifests as:
- missing commitments
- broken custody chains
- unverifiable timelines
- access anomalies

These are **signals**, not judgments.

---

## Why TDV Is Dangerous if Misframed

TDV threatens:
- narrative control
- discretionary overrides
- plausible deniability
- audit-as-interpretation

Therefore TDV must be framed as:
- risk infrastructure
- compliance infrastructure
- evidence custody
- verification enablement

**Never** as surveillance.  
**Never** as exposure.

---

## Civilizational Function (One Line)

**TDV converts institutional memory from a narrative claim into a verifiable property of time.**

---

## Final Constraint

TDV:
- does not make institutions moral
- does not eliminate corruption
- does not enforce justice

It ensures only this:

> **If something happened, it cannot later be erased from institutional reality without leaving a trace.**

That is its entire purpose.
