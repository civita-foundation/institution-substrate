# ARC 1 — Ontology  
## Trust & Coordination

---

## Why Trust Needs Ontology

“Trust” is one of the most abused words in:
- governance
- economics
- culture
- leadership
- AI
- institutions

Most discussions treat trust as:
- emotion
- morality
- culture
- intention
- goodwill

This is ontologically incorrect.

## Ontological Definition of Coordination

> **Coordination is the reduction of behavioral uncertainty among multiple agents.**

Key implications:
- Coordination is about *predictability*, not agreement
- Coordination can occur without alignment of values
- Coordination does not require trust—but **scalable coordination does**

---

## Ontological Definition of Trust

> **Trust is the expectation that coordination constraints will be honored under uncertainty.**

This definition is:
- non-moral
- non-psychological
- structural
- falsifiable

Trust exists **only** where:
- uncertainty exists
- discretion exists
- stakes exist

No uncertainty → no trust required  
No discretion → no trust required

---

## Trust Is an Emergent Property

Trust is **not designed directly**.

It emerges when four conditions hold:

1. **Rules are legible**
2. **Constraints are enforceable**
3. **Execution is predictable**
4. **Violations are observable**

Remove any one → trust decays.

## Trust vs Belief (Critical Distinction)

| Concept | Depends On |
|------|-----------|
| Belief | Internal cognition |
| Trust | External structure |

People may *believe* in a system they do not *trust*.  
People may *trust* a system they do not *believe in*.

Institutions operate on trust, not belief.

---

## Trust Is Directional

Trust is not symmetric.

Examples:
- Citizens may trust courts more than courts trust citizens
- Employees may trust payroll more than leadership
- Banks may trust clients less than clients trust banks

This asymmetry is normal—and structural.

---

## Coordination Without Trust (Local Mode)

Low-scale coordination can happen via:
- kinship
- surveillance
- violence
- charisma
- repeated interaction

These methods do **not scale**.

They collapse when:
- population grows
- anonymity increases
- time horizons lengthen

---

## Trust as Compression

Trust functions as a **compression mechanism**.

Without trust:
- every interaction requires verification
- transaction costs explode
- coordination becomes quadratic or worse

With trust:
- behavior space compresses
- fewer checks are required
- coordination scales

Trust is therefore a **computational shortcut**.

---

## The Trust–Discretion Tradeoff

Every institution balances:

- **Discretion** (flexibility)
- **Trust** (predictability)

Increasing discretion without structure:
→ trust collapse

Eliminating discretion entirely:
→ rigidity & brittleness

The optimal zone is *structured discretion*.

---

## Coordination Breakdown Modes

Trust collapses structurally when:

1. Rules exist but are unenforced
2. Enforcement exists but is selective
3. Execution depends on individuals
4. Exceptions accumulate silently
5. Outcomes differ from expectations repeatedly

This produces:
- cynicism
- gaming
- shadow systems
- informal workarounds

These are **adaptive responses**, not moral failures.

---

## Trust Is Not Binary

Trust is:
- contextual
- scoped
- layered

People trust:
- *this* function
- *in this context*
- *up to this limit*

Institutional design fails when trust is assumed to be global.

---

## Trust Surfaces, Not Trust Itself

You cannot “build trust” directly.

You can only build:
- observability
- constraint clarity
- execution reliability
- memory continuity

Trust emerges or it does not.

---

## Bridge to SCT-F

This ontology directly leads to:

> **SCT-F** — Structural Conditions for Trust Feasibility

Which asks:
- When *can* trust exist?
- When *must* it fail?
- What makes trust infeasible regardless of intention?

SCT-F is not a theory of behavior.  
It is a theory of **structural possibility**.

---

## What Comes Next

We now know:
- what institutions are
- how coordination works
- what trust *is*

Next, we must define:
- how trust survives **time**
- how institutions remember
- why decay is inevitable without memory

This leads to **Ontology of Time & Memory**.
