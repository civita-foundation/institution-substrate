# ARC 2.1 — Ontology of Trust
## Trust as a Structural Variable

---

## Why an Ontology of Trust Is Required

Most theories treat trust as:
- a feeling
- a belief
- a cultural trait
- a moral attribute

This makes trust:
- unmeasurable
- ungovernable
- unfalsifiable

> **SCT-F requires trust to be modeled structurally.**

---

## Definition: Trust (Institutional Sense)

> **Trust is the expectation that another agent will act within acceptable bounds in the absence of immediate verification or enforcement.**

Key properties:
- forward-looking
- probabilistic
- unverifiable at decision time
- contingent on memory and enforcement

Trust is not good or bad.  
It is a **risk assumption**.

---

## Trust as Deferred Verification

Trust exists when:
- verification is delayed
- enforcement is uncertain
- outcomes are asymmetric

If verification is immediate and enforcement automatic:
> **Trust is unnecessary.**

---

## Trust Is a Substitute for Structure

Historically:
- trust fills gaps where structure is missing
- trust compensates for weak enforcement
- trust masks ambiguity in rules

This works at small scale.
It collapses at institutional scale.

---

## Trust Is Not Binary

Trust exists on a spectrum:
- High confidence
- Conditional confidence
- Strategic skepticism
- Adversarial expectation

Institutions must function across the entire spectrum.

SCT-F assumes **trust-minimal conditions** by default.

---

## Trust vs Legitimacy

Often conflated, but distinct:

### Trust
- expectation of behavior
- actor-specific
- reversible

### Legitimacy
- acceptance of authority
- system-level
- slow-moving

Loss of trust accelerates loss of legitimacy, but they are not the same.

---

## The Trust Load Concept

> **Trust Load** = the amount of belief required for an institution to function.

High trust load institutions:
- rely on discretion
- require goodwill
- collapse under stress

Low trust load institutions:
- rely on structure
- tolerate adversarial actors
- degrade gracefully

SCT-F aims to **minimize trust load**.

---

## Trust Debt

When institutions:
- postpone verification
- tolerate ambiguity
- excuse deviations

They accumulate **trust debt**.

Trust debt manifests later as:
- scandal
- corruption exposure
- sudden legitimacy collapse

---

## Why Trust Decays

Trust decays due to:
- incentive misalignment
- information asymmetry
- memory loss
- selective enforcement
- power concentration

These are structural, not moral failures.

---

## Trust Cannot Be Engineered Directly

Attempts to “build trust” via:
- culture programs
- values statements
- ethics training
- narratives

Fail because they do not change:
- incentives
- enforcement
- memory
- execution constraints

Trust responds to structure, not rhetoric.

---

## Structural Replacement of Trust

Trust can be reduced or eliminated by:
- explicit rules
- deterministic execution
- verifiable outcomes
- durable memory
- bounded discretion

These are the building blocks of CI, SFEU, and TDV.

---

## The SCT-F Position

> **Trust is an expensive, fragile coordination primitive.  
Institutions must minimize dependence on it.**

This is not cynicism.
It is realism under scale.

---

## Transition Within ARC 2

Next, we must explain:
- how trust decays over time
- how decay becomes corruption
- how coordination fails structurally

This leads directly to **Trust Decay & Institutional Corruption**.
