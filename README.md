# Institution Substrate
## Science & Engineering of Executable Institutions

## What This Project Is

This repository formalizes **Institution Substrate**:
a unified framework explaining **why institutions succeed, fail, decay, or persist** under real-world constraints.

It integrates:

- institutional ontology
- feasibility theory (SCT-F)
- execution mechanisms (CI → DNI → SFEU)
- institutional memory (TDV)
- time, drift, and recovery
- energy as state-change under constraint

The goal is **not reform optimism**, but **structural truth**.

---

## Core Question

> Under what conditions can an institution continue to function *without lying to itself*?

Everything here serves that question.

---

## What Problem This Solves

Existing institutional theories explain:
- incentives
- growth
- power
- legitimacy

They do **not** explain:
- why institutions decay despite knowledge and technology
- why reforms fail even when “correct”
- why trust collapses faster than capacity grows
- why complexity becomes fatal

Institution Substrate addresses this gap.

## Conceptual Stack (Canonical)

```
SCT-F → feasibility constraint
CI → institutional ontology
ENI → execution infrastructure
DNI → design hypothesis
SFEU → rule execution
TDV → institutional memory
Energy → state-change capacity under constraint
```


This stack is **closed and falsifiable**.

### Boundary Routing (ARC BR)

ARC BR is a **normative specification** defining inter-institution execution semantics under trust-minimal conditions.

Boundary Routing specifies how institutional state transitions propagate or explicitly refuse across institutional boundaries **without discretion, interpretation, or implicit trust**.

Any system claiming support for Boundary Routing or inter-institution executability **MUST conform** to ARC BR or explicitly declare a fork.

5. Drift, Recovery, Evolution  
6. AI Failure & RSI Boundaries  
7. Energy Ontology  
8. Lineage & Positioning

Files are written to be:
- read sequentially, or
- imported selectively into other projects

## What This Project Is Not

- Not a governance platform
- Not a policy playbook
- Not an AI system
- Not a utopian vision

It does **not** claim:
- universal applicability
- moral authority
- inevitability of success

---

## Intended Audience

- institutional designers
- economists and political economists
- governance engineers
- AI transformation leaders
- global institutions (e.g. development banks, governments)

This is **PhD-level work**, written for clarity, not obscurity.

---

## Intellectual Lineage

This work builds on and extends:
- Searle (status functions)
- Ostrom (commons & governance)
- North / Acemoglu (institutions & credibility)
- Tainter (complexity collapse)
- Hall / biophysical economics (energy constraints)
- Wiener (cybernetics & feedback)

Full positioning is in `20_lineage_and_positioning.md`.

## Final Note

This repository does not promise solutions.

It promises something rarer:

> **A way to tell, early and honestly, when an institution cannot work.**
