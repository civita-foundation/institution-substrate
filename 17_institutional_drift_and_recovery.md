## ARC C — Time, Drift, & Institutional Evolution (System Level)

---

## 1. Why Drift Is the Central Institutional Problem

Most institutional theories obsess over **design**.
Most institutional failures occur due to **time**.

Institutions rarely fail because:
- rules were incorrect,
- intentions were malicious,
- values were absent.

They fail because **structures drift away from their original constraints**.

Drift is not an anomaly.
Drift is the default state of institutions over time.

Any institutional theory that does not treat drift as a *first-class phenomenon* is incomplete.

---

## 2. What Institutional Drift Actually Is

**Institutional drift** is:

> The gradual divergence between an institution’s *formal rule intent* and its *actual executed outcomes* over time, without explicit rule change.

Key characteristics:
- incremental, not abrupt,
- usually invisible until advanced,
- often rationalized as “exceptions” or “context.”

Drift is not:
- a single failure,
- a policy error,
- a moral lapse.

Drift is a **temporal systems property**.

**Energy Dependency (ARC-E):**  
Institutional drift is a time-extended energy failure where maintaining existing execution paths becomes costlier than informal alternatives.

## 3. Sources of Drift (Structural, Not Moral)

Drift emerges from predictable sources:

### 3.1 Interpretive Accretion
Humans reinterpret rules to handle edge cases.
Interpretations accumulate.
Rules silently change.

### 3.2 Discretion Expansion
Temporary discretion becomes permanent.
Emergency powers normalize.
Execution shifts from rule-bound to person-bound.

### 3.3 Memory Loss
Past decisions cannot be reconstructed.
Precedent degrades into narrative.
Institutions forget why rules existed.

### 3.4 Latency Mismatch
Decision cycles slow.
Reality accelerates.
Institutions respond too late to remain relevant.

None of these require corruption.
They require only time.

## 4. Drift vs Failure vs Corruption

These are commonly conflated. They are not the same.

| Phenomenon | Definition |
|---|---|
Drift | Silent divergence over time |
Failure | Observable breakdown of function |
Corruption | Intentional misuse of authority |

Drift can exist without corruption.  
Corruption can exist without drift.  
Failure is often **the end-stage of unmanaged drift**.

This distinction is essential for diagnosis.

## 5. Why Traditional Institutions Cannot Recover

Traditional institutions lack three capabilities:

1. **Verifiable Memory**  
   Past actions cannot be reconstructed without trust.

2. **Execution Baselines**  
   There is no invariant reference for “correct execution.”

3. **Non-Discretionary Reset Paths**  
   Recovery requires political will, not structural triggers.

As a result:
- drift is detected late,
- recovery is politicized,
- reform becomes revolutionary instead of corrective.

## 6. DNI-Specific Drift Dynamics

DNIs change the drift equation.

Because DNIs have:
- SFEU (execution invariance),
- TDV (temporal verifiability),
- ENI (runtime isolation),

drift manifests differently.

In a DNI:
- rules do not silently change,
- execution does not reinterpret intent,
- memory does not decay.

Instead, drift appears as:
- mis-specified rules,
- outdated constraints,
- feasibility erosion.

This is crucial:
> DNIs do not eliminate drift.  
> They **surface drift earlier and cleanly**.

---

## 7. Recovery Without Collapse

A DNI enables **non-revolutionary recovery**.

Recovery mechanisms include:
- rule revision with preserved execution history,
- parallel rule testing without live override,
- explicit versioning of institutional logic,
- rollback with evidence, not blame.

Recovery becomes:
- technical,
- auditable,
- reversible.

Not political theater.

---

## 8. The Limits of Recovery

DNIs cannot recover from:
- invalid value assumptions,
- infeasible coordination demands,
- environments that have fundamentally changed.

At some point, institutions must:
- evolve,
- split,
- or dissolve.

The advantage of DNIs is not immortality.
It is **honest failure**.

---

## 9. Summary: Drift as a First-Class Design Variable

Drift is not a bug.
It is the temporal cost of institutional existence.

Traditional institutions hide drift.
DNIs expose it.

The purpose of institutional engineering is not to prevent drift,
but to ensure that:

> Drift is visible, bounded, and recoverable  
> before it metastasizes into collapse.
