## Canonical Ontology — Institution Substrate

---

## Purpose of This File

This document defines the **canonical ontology** for the *Institution Substrate* project.

- Every concept in this project **must** map to a definition here.
- No concept may have multiple meanings.
- If a term is not defined here, it **does not exist** in this system.

This file is **normative** and **frozen** once finalized.

## Ontological Primitives

### 1. System
A bounded set of states, constraints, and transition rules.

A system exists if:
- it can occupy distinguishable states
- transitions between states are constrained

---

### 2. State
A distinguishable configuration of a system at a given moment.

A state is:
- not subjective
- not narrative
- fully defined by system variables

---

### 3. Constraint
A rule, limit, or boundary that restricts possible state transitions.

Constraints:
- do not create energy
- shape how energy propagates
- define feasibility

---

### 4. Energy
The **capacity of a system to undergo state change under constraints**.

Energy:
- is relational, not intrinsic
- exists only relative to constraints
- is potential until exercised
- is directional (state A → state B)

Energy is **not**:
- substance
- force
- value
- morality
- intention

---

### 5. Time
The ordering dimension across which state changes may occur.

Time:
- enables deferred state change
- introduces decay, accumulation, and irreversibility
- is required for persistence and memory

---

### 6. Memory
Persistent representation of past state transitions across time.

Memory:
- is not recall
- is not interpretation
- is the condition for accountability

---

## Institutional Ontology

### 7. Institution
A constraint system that shapes and stabilizes coordinated state changes among agents across time.

An institution:
- does not require organization
- does not require formal authority
- exists if constraints persist and propagate behavior

---

### 8. Coordination
The alignment of multiple agents’ state changes into a coherent collective trajectory.

Coordination:
- amplifies energy
- increases output nonlinearly
- increases fragility under low trust

---

### 9. Trust
A structural property that reduces resistance to energy propagation across constraints.

Trust:
- lowers coordination cost
- reduces enforcement overhead
- is measurable via friction, delay, and leakage

Trust is **not** belief or morality.

---

### 10. Corruption
Systematic misrouting or leakage of energy relative to institutional constraints.

Corruption includes:
- bribery
- delay
- discretionary override
- data manipulation
- institutional amnesia

Corruption is a **structural phenomenon**, not a moral one.

---

## Feasibility Ontology (SCT-F)

### 11. Surplus
Net usable energy available for state change after baseline maintenance.

Surplus may be:
- fiscal
- energetic
- cognitive
- temporal
- institutional

---

### 12. Complexity Cost
The cumulative energy required to maintain coordination, enforcement, and abstraction.

Complexity cost increases with:
- rule depth
- exception handling
- discretion
- scale

---

### 13. Trust Deficit
A nonlinear multiplier representing resistance to coordination due to legitimacy decay.

Trust deficit:
- amplifies complexity cost
- accelerates failure under scale
- cannot be offset reliably by surplus alone

---

## Computation & Execution Ontology

### 14. Computable Institution (CI)
An institution whose constitutive rules and status functions are explicitly representable as rule-bound state transitions.

CI is:
- an ontological class
- not an implementation
- independent of technology choice

---

### 15. Execution-Native Infrastructure (ENI)
The minimal runtime substrate that enables deterministic rule execution and durable evidence persistence.

ENI:
- is not governance
- is not policy
- is not decision-making
- exists to make execution and memory possible

---

### 16. Digital Native Institution (DNI)
An institution whose constitutive rules are executed directly via non-interpretive execution units rather than mediated by human discretion.

DNI:
- reduces coordination cost
- reduces trust load
- does not eliminate governance

---

### 17. Status-Function Execution Unit (SFEU)
An execution-only, non-interpretive unit that produces institutional state transitions according to formalized rules.

SFEU:
- executes
- does not judge
- does not interpret
- does not remember

SFEU exists only in the present tense.

---

### 18. Trusted Data Vault (TDV)
A protocol-bound evidence custody layer that preserves execution traces such that past institutional reality remains reconstructible without trust in the institution or its operators.

TDV:
- does not execute
- does not interpret
- does not govern
- exists across time

TDV is institutional memory without institutional trust.

---

## Evolution & Failure Ontology

### 19. Drift
Gradual divergence between intended institutional function and actual state transitions over time.

Drift may arise from:
- accumulated discretion
- memory decay
- unbounded exception handling
- trust erosion

---

### 20. Failure
A condition where institutional state transitions become infeasible under SCT-F constraints.

Failure is:
- structural
- predictable
- non-moral

---

### 21. Recovery
The re-alignment of institutional constraints, execution, and memory such that feasible state transitions resume.

Recovery does not imply:
- justice
- fairness
- optimality

Only feasibility.

---

## Boundary Ontology

### 22. Governance
Human judgment over rule definition, exception authorization, and system evolution.

Governance:
- must not execute rules
- must not rewrite memory
- exists above execution

---

### 23. Execution
Deterministic realization of rules as state transitions.

Execution:
- must not judge
- must not interpret
- must not evolve rules

---

### 24. RSI (Restricted Scope Intelligence)
A bounded supervisory system that monitors execution, drift, and feasibility without acting as an agent or decision-maker.

RSI:
- does not hold authority
- does not possess agency
- does not replace governance

---

## Final Ontological Constraint

This ontology **does not** assert:
- morality
- legitimacy
- desirability
- destiny
- utopia

It asserts only:
> what exists, what can move, and what can persist under constraint.
