## Canonical Ontology — Institution Substrate (v2.0)

---

## Purpose

This document defines the **canonical ontology** for the *Institution Substrate* project.

- Every concept in this project **must** map to a definition here.
- No term may have multiple meanings.
- If a term is not defined here, it **does not exist** in this system.

This file is **normative**.  
Changes require explicit justification and versioning.

---

## Ontological Primitives

### 1. System  
A bounded set of states, constraints, and transition rules.

A system exists if:
- it can occupy distinguishable states, and
- transitions between states are constrained.

---

### 2. State  
A distinguishable configuration of a system at a given moment.

A state is:
- non-subjective,
- non-narrative,
- fully defined by system variables.

---

### 3. Constraint  
A rule, limit, or boundary that restricts possible state transitions.

Constraints:
- do not create energy,
- shape how energy propagates,
- define feasibility.

---

### 4. Energy  
The **capacity of a system to undergo state change under constraints**.

Energy:
- is relational, not intrinsic,
- exists only relative to constraints,
- is potential until exercised,
- is directional (state A → state B).

Energy is **not**:
- substance,
- force,
- value,
- morality,
- intention.

---

### 5. Time  
The ordering dimension across which state changes may occur.

In institutional systems:
- time accumulates via irreversible decisions under constraint,
- time enables deferred state change,
- time introduces irreversibility and path dependence.

---

### 6. Memory  
The persistence of constraint-relevant information across time.

Memory:
- is not recall,
- is not interpretation,
- constrains future action,
- is the condition for accountability.

---

## Institutional Ontology

### 7. Institution  
A constraint system that shapes and stabilizes coordinated state changes among agents across time.

An institution:
- does not require an organization,
- does not require formal authority,
- exists if constraints persist beyond individuals.

---

### 8. Coordination  
The reduction of behavioral uncertainty among multiple agents through constrained state transitions.

Coordination:
- amplifies energy,
- increases output non-linearly,
- increases fragility under low trust.

---

### 9. Trust  
A structural property that reduces resistance to energy propagation across constraints.

Trust:
- lowers coordination cost,
- reduces enforcement overhead,
- substitutes verification with expectation.

Trust is **not** belief, morality, or goodwill.

---

### 10. Legitimacy  
A system-level authorization that permits specific state transitions to be recognized as **institutionally valid**, independent of actor trust.

Legitimacy:
- is slower-moving than trust,
- is system-scoped, not actor-scoped,
- defines whether execution outcomes *count*.

Loss of legitimacy withdraws permission for energy to mobilize action.

---

### 11. Authority  
A **status function** that specifies which agents or artifacts are permitted to trigger particular institutional state transitions under defined constraints.

Authority:
- is not power,
- is not discretion,
- is not enforcement,
- exists only relative to formal rules.

Authority may be:
- encoded,
- delegated,
- revoked,
- routed.

---

### 12. Corruption  
Systematic misrouting or leakage of energy relative to institutional constraints **without immediate structural consequence**.

Corruption is:
- structural, not moral,
- possible with or without illegality,
- enabled by discretion, opacity, and weak memory.

---

## Feasibility Ontology (SCT-F)

### 13. Surplus  
Net usable energy available for state change after baseline maintenance.

Surplus may be:
- fiscal,
- energetic,
- cognitive,
- temporal,
- institutional.

---

### 14. Complexity Cost  
The cumulative energy required to maintain coordination, enforcement, and abstraction.

Complexity cost increases with:
- rule depth,
- exception handling,
- discretion,
- scale.

---

### 15. Trust Deficit  
A nonlinear multiplier representing resistance to coordination due to legitimacy decay and unverifiable execution.

Trust deficit:
- amplifies complexity cost,
- accelerates failure under scale,
- cannot be reliably offset by surplus alone.

---

## Computation & Execution Ontology

### 16. Computable Institution (CI)  
An institution whose constitutive rules and status functions are explicitly representable as rule-bound state transitions.

CI:
- is ontological, not technical,
- does not imply execution,
- defines what *can* be made executable.

---

### 17. Execution-Native Infrastructure (ENI)  
The minimal runtime substrate that enables deterministic rule execution, explicit time semantics, and durable evidence emission.

ENI:
- is not governance,
- is not policy,
- is not decision-making,
- exists to make execution and memory possible.

---

### 18. Digital Native Institution (DNI)  
An institution whose constitutive rules are executed directly via non-interpretive execution units rather than mediated by human discretion.

DNI:
- minimizes trust load,
- reduces coordination cost,
- externalizes memory,
- does not eliminate governance.

---

### 19. Status-Function Execution Unit (SFEU)  
An execution-only, non-interpretive unit that produces institutional state transitions according to formalized rules.

SFEU:
- executes,
- does not judge,
- does not interpret,
- does not remember.

SFEU exists only in the present tense.

---

### 20. Temporal Data Verifiability (TDV)  
A protocol-bound evidence persistence and custody layer that preserves execution traces such that past institutional reality remains verifiable across time **without reliance on trust** in the institution or its operators.

TDV:
- does not execute,
- does not interpret,
- does not govern,
- preserves institutional memory.

TDV is **verification without trust**, not surveillance.

---

## Boundary & Intelligence Ontology

### 21. Governance  
Human judgment over rule definition, exception authorization, and institutional evolution.

Governance:
- operates in slow time,
- must not execute rules,
- must not rewrite memory.

---

### 22. Execution  
Deterministic realization of formal rules as state transitions.

Execution:
- must not judge,
- must not interpret,
- must not evolve rules.

---

### 23. Boundary Routing  
The deterministic propagation of institutional state transitions across institutional boundaries, preserving authority provenance, rule version, execution order, and TDV-verifiable memory **without requiring trust between institutions**.

Boundary routing:
- is execution continuation, not messaging,
- is legitimacy-sensitive,
- may explicitly refuse propagation.

---

### 24. Restricted-Scope Intelligence (RSI)  
A bounded supervisory system that monitors execution, drift, and feasibility **without holding authority or agency**.

RSI:
- does not decide,
- does not execute,
- does not govern,
- surfaces signals for human governance.

---

## Evolution & Failure Ontology

### 25. Drift  
Gradual divergence between intended institutional constraints and actual executed state transitions over time.

Drift arises from:
- accumulated discretion,
- memory decay,
- silent exception normalization.

---

### 26. Failure  
A condition where institutional state transitions become infeasible under SCT-F constraints.

Failure is:
- structural,
- predictable,
- non-moral.

---

### 27. Recovery  
The re-alignment of institutional constraints, execution, and memory such that feasible state transitions resume.

Recovery:
- does not imply justice,
- does not imply optimality,
- implies feasibility restoration only.

---

## Final Ontological Constraint

This ontology **does not assert**:
- morality,
- desirability,
- legitimacy as virtue,
- political correctness,
- utopia.

It asserts only:

> **What exists, what can change state, and what can persist under constraint.**
