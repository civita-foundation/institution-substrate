## Purpose of This File

This file establishes the **intellectual lineage, positioning, and novelty claims** of the Institution Substrate framework.

Its objectives are to:
- Credit prior thinkers precisely
- Avoid dilution or “theory soup”
- Clarify what is **subsumed**, **extended**, or **contradicted**
- Establish epistemic legitimacy without appeal to authority

This is not a literature review.
It is a **structural lineage map**.

## Orientation: What This Work Is Doing Differently

Most institutional theories focus on:
- equilibrium
- incentives
- culture
- power
- or growth outcomes

This work focuses on a different question:

> **Why do institutions fail structurally even when technology, knowledge, and intent improve?**

The answer is pursued through:
- feasibility constraints
- execution vs discretion separation
- time, memory, and evidence durability

## Core Lineage — Diagnosis Layer (WHY institutions fail)

### Joseph Tainter — Diminishing Returns to Complexity
**Contribution:**
- Societies collapse when added complexity yields declining marginal returns.

**What is subsumed:**
- Complexity as a *cost*, not a free good.

**What is extended:**
- Complexity cost is made **formal, ongoing, and institution-specific**.
- Integrated directly into a feasibility inequality (SCT-F).

**What is missing in Tainter (and added here):**
- Trust as a nonlinear multiplier
- Execution and memory mechanisms

---

### Charles Hall / Biophysical Economics
**Contribution:**
- Energy surplus (EROI) is the binding constraint of civilization.

**What is subsumed:**
- Surplus is finite and physically grounded.

**What is extended:**
- Surplus generalized beyond energy to:
  - fiscal capacity
  - cognitive bandwidth
  - administrative time

This work treats **surplus as multi-dimensional**, not monetary.

---

### Vaclav Smil
**Contribution:**
- Material, energetic, and infrastructural realism.
- Civilizational optimism constrained by physics.

**Role in this framework:**
- Smil anchors the **non-negotiability of physical limits**.
- Prevents institutional theories from drifting into abstraction.

---

## Core Lineage — Trust & Legitimacy

### Douglass North
**Contribution:**
- Institutions reduce uncertainty via credible commitments.

**What is subsumed:**
- Credibility as central to institutional performance.

**What is extended:**
- Credibility is reframed as **trust load** affecting feasibility, not just transaction cost.

---

### Elinor Ostrom
**Contribution:**
- Polycentric governance
- Local trust and rule legitimacy

**What is subsumed:**
- Institutions can work without central coercion.

**What is extended:**
- Ostrom’s insights are embedded into **formal execution feasibility**, not just governance design.

---

### Robert Putnam
**Contribution:**
- Social capital density affects coordination efficiency.

**What is subsumed:**
- Trust decay raises coordination cost.

**What is extended:**
- Trust is made **quantitatively consequential** via SCT-F, not merely sociological.

---

### Francis Fukuyama
**Contribution:**
- Trust as a macro-scale enabler of institutional complexity.

**What is subsumed:**
- High-trust societies scale institutions more cheaply.

**What is extended:**
- Trust becomes a **structural multiplier**, not a cultural descriptor.

---

## Formal Ontology Lineage (WHAT institutions are)

### John Searle
**Contribution:**
- Status functions
- Constitutive rules
- Institutional facts as social constructs

**What is subsumed:**
- Institutions are rule-based status assignments.

**What is extended:**
- Rules must be **computable and explicit** to be institutionally reliable.
- Narrative ambiguity is removed.

This leads directly to **Computable Institutions (CI)**.

---

## Political Economy & Growth Theory (WHY insufficient)

### Acemoglu & Robinson
**Contribution:**
- Inclusive vs extractive institutions
- Political power and incentives

**Limitation:**
- Explains *who benefits*, not *why institutions become unmanageable*.

**This work adds:**
- A feasibility constraint independent of ideology or regime type.

---

### Aghion / Mokyr
**Contribution:**
- Innovation, growth, and institutional adaptability.

**Limitation:**
- Growth-centric framing assumes institutional capacity.

**This work adds:**
- Institutions may fail **before** growth mechanisms can operate.

---

## Execution & Computation Lineage (HOW institutions act)

### Formal Systems / Automata Theory
**Contribution:**
- Rule-bound state transitions.

**Role here:**
- Foundation for **SFEU** as execution-only units.

---

### Mechanism Design
**Contribution:**
- Incentive-compatible rule design.

**Limitation:**
- Assumes reliable execution and memory.

**This work adds:**
- Execution and memory as first-class constraints.

---

## Time, Memory, and Evidence (WHY institutions decay over time)

### Auditability & Forensic Accounting
**Contribution:**
- Evidence preservation
- Chain of custody

**What is extended:**
- Evidence becomes constitutive infrastructure (TDV), not compliance afterthought.

### Norbert Wiener — Cybernetics, Feedback, and Control

**Contribution:**
- Systems fail not only from bad rules, but from delayed feedback, noise, and loss of control.
- Stability requires continuous sensing, memory, and corrective action.

**What is subsumed:**
- Institutions are control systems, not static rule sets.

**What is extended:**
- TDV is formalized as a cybernetic memory layer enabling institutional feedback across time.
- Institutional drift is treated as a control failure, not a moral or political one.

**Why Wiener matters here:**
- Without cybernetics, execution-native institutions freeze or oscillate.
- Wiener explains why *time* is a first-class institutional problem.


---

### Legal Evidence Theory
**Contribution:**
- Immutability, custody, admissibility.

**What is extended:**
- Institutional memory without institutional trust.

---

## What Is New (Precise Claims)

This framework introduces:

1. **SCT-F** — a unified feasibility constraint integrating:
   - surplus
   - complexity
   - trust

2. **CI** — institutions as computable rule systems.

3. **DNI** — a falsifiable design hypothesis to compress feasibility costs.

4. **SFEU** — execution separated from judgment.

5. **TDV** — institutional memory without institutional trust.

Together, they form a **closed causal system** spanning:
diagnosis → design → execution → memory → evolution.

---

## What This Work Does NOT Claim

- Moral superiority
- Universal applicability
- Replacement of politics
- Guaranteed institutional success

It claims **structural explainability and falsifiability**, nothing more.

---

## Positioning Summary (One Paragraph)

This work stands at the intersection of institutional economics, social ontology, biophysical constraint theory, and computation. It does not reject prior theories; it **re-bounds them by feasibility**, adds execution and memory as first-class constraints, and explains institutional decay as a structural outcome rather than a moral or ideological failure.
