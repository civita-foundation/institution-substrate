# ARC E — Energy Ontology Under Constraint
## Energy as State-Change Capacity (Foundational Primitive)

---

## Purpose of This File

This file introduces **energy** as a **first-class ontological primitive** required
to make the Institution Substrate coherent across:

- SCT-F (feasibility)
- CI (ontology)
- ENI (execution)
- SFEU (actuation)
- TDV (persistence)
- Institutional drift, collapse, and recovery

This file **does not** replace any existing file.
It **closes a gap** that was previously implicit.

## Core Ontological Definition (Frozen)

> **Energy is the capacity of a system to propagate state-change under constraint.**

This definition is:
- ontological (what energy *is*)
- not domain-specific
- not metaphorical
- not moral
- not substance-based

Energy exists **only** relative to:
1. states
2. constraints
3. pathways
4. time

No constraints → no energy  
No state difference → no energy  
No pathway → no energy  

---

## Why This Definition Is Required

Mainstream definitions fail for institutional analysis:

1. **Physics shorthand**  
   “Energy is the ability to do work”  
   → describes effect, not ontology

2. **Economic intuition**  
   “Energy = money/resources”  
   → collapses storage with propagation

3. **Spiritual abstraction**  
   “Energy flows everywhere”  
   → unconstrained, unfalsifiable

SCT-F, CI, and DNI require a definition that explains:
- why trust matters
- why coordination amplifies
- why complexity decays
- why institutions collapse despite abundance

Only a **constraint-relative definition** works.

## Energy and Constraints (Key Shift)

Energy is **not the mover**.  
Energy is what becomes available **because movement is possible but not free**.

| Domain        | Constraint Type            | Energy Manifests As                |
|--------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Physics      | Physical laws              | Kinetic / potential energy         |
| Institutions | Rules, legitimacy, trust   | Authority, compliance, action      |
| Economy      | Scarcity, contracts        | Value flow                         |
| Cognition    | Attention, memory          | Thought, intention                 |
| Governance   | Coordination cost          | Collective action                  |

Energy is **relational**, not intrinsic.

---

## Energy in SCT-F (Formal Role)

SCT-F is a **feasibility constraint on energy propagation**.

Rewritten ontologically:

> Institutions are sustainable **iff**  
> available state-change capacity  
> exceeds dissipation caused by complexity and trust loss.

Where:
- **Surplus** = available energy
- **Complexity** = dissipation cost
- **Trust deficit** = loss multiplier

Corruption, delay, bureaucracy, and drift are **energy losses**, not moral failures.

## Energy vs Commonly Confused Terms (Frozen Separation)

| Term        | Ontological Role                           |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Energy     | Capacity for state change                   |
| Force      | Directional application of energy           |
| Power      | Control over energy pathways                |
| Value      | Socially recognized energy outcome          |
| Trust      | Energy transmission efficiency              |
| Legitimacy | Permission for energy to mobilize action    |

Collapsing these produces institutional confusion.

## What Counts as Energy (SCT-F Ontology)

The following qualify **iff** they enable constrained state change:

1. **Money** — encoded exchange energy  
2. **Value** — socially validated energy outcome  
3. **Trust** — low-loss transmission coefficient  
4. **Legitimacy** — authority-mobilizing energy  
5. **Attention** — cognitive allocation energy  
6. **Information** — state-selection energy  
7. **Time** — deferred propagation capacity  
8. **Coordination** — collective amplification energy  
9. **Institutions** — energy routing architectures  
10. **Flow** — sustained propagation regime

None are “energy” by metaphor.
All are energy by **state-change capacity under constraint**.

## What Is Not Energy

The following are **not energy** unless they cause state change:

- morality
- ideology
- intention
- belief
- narrative
- identity
- aspiration

Energy requires **execution or propagation**.

---

## Implications for CI, DNI, ENI, SFEU, TDV

- **CI** defines which energy paths are computable
- **DNI** reduces trust load on energy propagation
- **ENI** provides the plumbing for energy execution
- **SFEU** actuates energy into state transitions
- **TDV** preserves energy history against entropy

Institutions do not create energy.  
They **route, block, amplify, or trap it**.

---

## Collapse, Reform, and Evolution (Energy View)

- **Collapse** = energy trapped, leaked, or overdissipated
- **Corruption** = misrouted energy
- **Reform** = rerouting energy without destroying constraints
- **Evolution** = new stable energy pathways under new constraints

This explains why reforms fail even with “good policy”.

---

## Final Ontological Synthesis (One Line)

> **Anything that can cause a system to change state and survive constraints long enough to propagate is energy.**

Money is one form.  
Institutions are energy architectures.  
Flow is energy kept alive.

## Status

This file is **foundational**.
It should be read **before or alongside SCT-F**.

No further abstraction is required.
