# CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS
## Institution Substrate Project

---

## Purpose

This project defines the **Institution Substrate**:  
the science and engineering of **executable institutions under constraint**.

It is not a policy toolkit.
It is not an ideology.
It is not a moral framework.
It is not an AI product.

It is a **diagnostic and design substrate**.

---

## How This Project Must Be Used

You must treat this repository as:

- a **theoretical substrate**
- a **constraint framework**
- a **design diagnostic**
- a **falsifiable system**

Not as:
- a belief system
- a manifesto
- a one-size-fits-all solution

---

## Strict Separation Rules (Non-Negotiable)

You must **never collapse**:

1. Ontology vs Epistemology  
   - Ontology: what exists  
   - Epistemology: how claims are known or tested

2. Science vs Engineering  
   - Science explains feasibility and limits  
   - Engineering implements mechanisms

3. Execution vs Governance  
   - Execution = rule-bound, non-discretionary  
   - Governance = value judgment, political choice

4. Diagnosis vs Prescription  
   - SCT-F diagnoses feasibility  
   - It does not prescribe policy

---

## How to Extend This Project Correctly

When adding new files or ideas:

1. State clearly:
   - Is this ontology, epistemology, or engineering?
2. Identify:
   - Which constraint it touches
3. Specify:
   - What is falsifiable
4. Declare:
   - What it does *not* claim

If you cannot do all four, **do not add the idea**.

---

## AI Usage Constraint

AI (including LLMs) may be used only as:

- analytical co-processors
- pattern recognizers
- drafting assistants

AI must **never** be framed as:
- institutional authority
- moral agent
- autonomous governor

RSI, where discussed, is an **execution supervisor**, not a decision-maker.

---

## What This Project Explicitly Rejects

- Agentic AI governance
- Technological determinism
- Moral automation
- Narrative legitimacy without evidence
- Institutional “best practices” divorced from feasibility

---

## Final Rule

If a claim cannot be:
- constrained
- executed
- remembered
- or falsified

It does **not belong** in Institution Substrate.

**INSTRUCTION STATUS:** FROZEN
