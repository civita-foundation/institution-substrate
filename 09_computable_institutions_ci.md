# ARC 3 — Computable Institutions (CI)
## From Narrative Institutions to Executable Structure

---

## Why ARC 3 Exists

ARC 2 established:
- trust decays structurally
- discretion fails under scale
- coordination requires determinism

ARC 3 derives the minimal institutional structure required for coordination once trust cannot be assumed.

## Structural Dependency (From SCT-F)

This arc does not stand alone.

The necessity of Computable Institutions (CI) is derived from
the constraints established in **ARC 2: Social Coordination Theory – Flow (SCT-F)**.

As shown in:
- **09a_sctf_to_ci_formal_coupling.md**

SCT-F demonstrates that under trust-minimal conditions:
- discretion introduces coordination drift
- interpretation diverges
- institutional facts become contestable

CI is therefore not a design preference.

It is the minimal institutional form that remains stable
once trust, scale, and time exceed human coordination limits.

## Classical Institutional View (Insufficient)

Traditional theories describe institutions as:
- norms
- laws
- incentives
- equilibria
- beliefs

These assume:
- interpretation
- enforcement discretion
- social legitimacy

They fail under trust-minimal conditions.

## Ontological Shift

This dissertation adopts a strict ontological move:

> **An institution is a system that produces authoritative state changes.**

Not narratives.  
Not promises.  
Not intentions.

---

## Searle’s Contribution (Foundation)

John Searle defined institutions as:
> “Status functions created by collective intentionality.”

Formally:
> X counts as Y in context C

Examples:
- Paper counts as money
- A person counts as a judge
- A signature counts as consent

This is necessary — but incomplete.

---

## The Problem With Narrative Status Functions

Searle’s formulation assumes:
- humans interpret X
- humans enforce Y
- humans remember C

Under trust decay:
- interpretation diverges
- enforcement is politicized
- memory is rewritten

Narrative institutions fracture.

## Definition: Computable Institution (CI)

A **Computable Institution** is:

> An institution whose constitutive rules, status functions, and state transitions are explicitly representable and evaluable as rule-bound computations.

Key properties:
- explicit rules
- finite states
- deterministic transitions
- no execution-time interpretation

---

## What “Computable” Means (Precisely)

Computable does **not** mean:
- digital
- blockchain
- automated
- optimized
- fast

It means:
- rule-complete
- unambiguous
- evaluable without discretion

A CI can be computed by:
- a machine
- a protocol
- or a human following rules mechanically

## CI vs Traditional Institutions

| Aspect | Traditional | CI |
|---|---|---|
| Rules | Implicit | Explicit |
| Execution | Discretionary | Deterministic |
| Enforcement | Interpretive | Rule-bound |
| Memory | Institutional | Externalizable |
| Trust Dependence | High | Minimized |

---

## Institutional Facts as State Transitions

In CI:
- institutional facts are not beliefs
- they are **state changes**

Example:
- “Payment completed” is not asserted
- it is derived from execution

If a fact cannot be derived:
- it does not exist institutionally

---

## CI Is Not Governance

CI does **not** decide:
- what rules *should* exist
- what outcomes are *just*
- what values matter

CI only specifies:
- how chosen rules act once adopted

Politics precedes CI.
Execution follows CI.

---

## Why CI Is Required (Link to SCT-F)

Recall SCT-F:

Surplus ≥ Complexity × Trust Deficit

CI directly compresses:
- complexity cost
- trust burden

By removing:
- interpretation
- exception
- discretion

CI is a **feasibility response**, not a moral claim.

---

## What CI Enables (Preview)

CI makes possible:
- Digital Native Institutions (DNI)
- Execution-native enforcement (SFEU)
- Externalized memory (TDV)
- Falsifiable institutions

These are not add-ons.
They are consequences.

---

## Formal Coupling Reference

For the necessity proof linking SCT-F to CI, see:

→ **09a_sctf_to_ci_formal_coupling.md**

This file establishes CI as a structural consequence of trust-minimal coordination,
not as an institutional ideal.


## Transition

We have defined **what an institution must be**.

Next we must define:
- how rules become executable
- how discretion is removed
- how execution is separated from governance

This leads to **ARC 4 — Digital Native Institutions (DNI)**.
