## ARC 2.2 — Trust Decay & Corruption

### From Coordination Aid to Structural Failure Mode

---

## Why Corruption Must Be Defined Structurally

Most discourse defines corruption as:

* moral failure
* criminal behavior
* cultural defect

These definitions are **non-operational**.

> **In institutional science, corruption is a structural outcome of trust decay under complexity and discretionary power.**

This definition is:

* non-moral
* non-cultural
* execution-relevant

---

## Definition: Trust (Operational)

> **Trust is a coordination compression mechanism that substitutes verification with expectation.**

Trust:

* reduces rule specificity
* tolerates discretion
* lowers enforcement cost

Trust is **not** a virtue.
It is a **structural shortcut**.

---

## Definition: Trust Decay

> **Trust decay is the cumulative erosion of coordination reliability caused by repeated unverifiable deviations from expected behavior.**

Properties:

* cumulative
* asymmetric (loss > gain)
* nonlinear
* often latent until collapse

Trust decays **stepwise**, not smoothly.

---

## The Trust → Discretion → Abuse Pathway

1. Trust substitutes for structure
2. Discretion expands
3. Verification weakens
4. Deviations normalize
5. Abuse becomes rational
6. Corruption stabilizes

No malice is required.

---

## Corruption (Institutional Definition)

> **Corruption is the systematic exploitation of discretionary gaps for private gain without immediate structural consequence.**

Key clarifications:

* illegality is optional
* secrecy is optional
* intent is irrelevant

Corruption requires only:

* discretion
* opacity
* weak memory
* delayed accountability

---

## Corruption Is an Equilibrium

Once established, corruption:

* aligns incentives
* repels rule-bound actors
* attracts opportunistic actors
* self-reinforces structurally

This is why:

> **Anti-corruption that targets people fails.**

---

## Complexity as an Amplifier

As institutions scale:

* interpretation increases
* coordination cost rises
* verification lags

Trust load increases faster than trust capacity.

This explains why:

* small systems survive on trust
* large systems collapse without structure

---

## Elite Capture Mechanism

High discretion + weak memory enables:

* selective enforcement
* insider privilege
* rule bending without detection

This produces:

* extractive equilibria
* defensive opacity
* institutional self-protection

---

## Why Transparency Fails Alone

Transparency without execution:

* increases narrative conflict
* overwhelms observers
* does not reduce discretion

> **Visibility without enforceability accelerates distrust.**

---

## Corruption vs Inefficiency

* **Inefficiency**: waste without intent
* **Corruption**: rent extraction enabled by structure

Both violate SCT-F.
Corruption accelerates collapse faster.

---

## Trust Collapse Dynamics

When trust crosses a threshold:

* compliance drops
* enforcement cost explodes
* coordination freezes or coerces

Institutions respond by:

* centralizing power
* increasing coercion
* rewriting narratives

These **increase trust decay further**.

**Energy Dependency (ARC-E):**  
Corruption is the re-routing of energy toward lower-resistance pathways when formal institutional channels become energetically inefficient.


---

## Structural Anti-Corruption (Preview)

Corruption is reduced by:

* removing discretion
* formalizing rules
* automating execution
* preserving memory
* separating custody

These are **CI / ENI / DNI / SFEU / TDV** interventions.

---

## SCT-F Interpretation

Trust decay increases **Trust Deficit**.

As Trust Deficit → 1:

* coordination cost explodes
* surplus requirements become infeasible
* collapse becomes structural

---

## Transition

Trust decay explains *why* institutions fail.
Next we explain *how coordination still works* when trust is minimal.
