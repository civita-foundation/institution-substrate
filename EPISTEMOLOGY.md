## How Knowledge Is Generated, Validated, and Rejected in Institution Substrate

---

## Purpose of This File

This document defines the **epistemological rules** governing the *Institution Substrate* project.

It specifies:
- what counts as knowledge
- what counts as evidence
- how claims are tested
- how errors are detected
- how theories evolve without collapse or dogma

This file is **normative**.

---

## Epistemic Stance (Non-Negotiable)

This project operates under **constraint-first epistemology**.

> A claim is valid *only if it survives contact with constraints*.

Narrative coherence, moral appeal, popularity, or authority **do not** establish truth.

---

## What Counts as Knowledge

### 1. Structural Knowledge
Knowledge about:
- constraints
- state spaces
- transition rules
- feasibility boundaries

Structural knowledge is preferred over:
- behavioral explanation
- intention-based reasoning
- post-hoc narratives

---

### 2. Executable Knowledge
A claim is stronger if it can be:
- formalized
- executed
- simulated
- audited
- replayed

Execution is a **truth amplifier**, not a truth source.

---

### 3. Negative Knowledge (Failure Knowledge)
This project treats **failure modes** as first-class knowledge.

If a theory explains success but not failure, it is incomplete.

---

## What Does *Not* Count as Knowledge

The following are explicitly excluded:

- Intentions without execution
- Moral assertions without mechanism
- Policies without feasibility analysis
- Correlations without causal structure
- AI outputs without boundary definition
- Interpretations without evidence durability

---

## Evidence Hierarchy

Evidence is ranked by durability and falsifiability.

### Tier 1 — Durable Evidence
- execution traces
- immutable records
- replayable state transitions
- TDV-backed timelines

### Tier 2 — Structural Evidence
- constraint analysis
- feasibility inequalities (e.g., SCT-F)
- invariants across contexts

### Tier 3 — Observational Evidence
- historical patterns
- institutional case studies
- cross-domain consistency

### Tier 4 — Narrative Evidence (Weak)
- expert opinion
- self-reporting
- ideology
- intent statements

Higher tiers override lower tiers.

---

## Falsifiability Rules

A claim must specify:
- what would break it
- under what conditions it fails
- what evidence would refute it

If a claim cannot be falsified, it is **excluded**.

---

## Causal Structure Requirement

All accepted theories must conform to:

```
Diagnosis → Constraint → Mechanism → Execution → Memory
```


Missing any stage renders the theory incomplete.

---

## Role of Mathematics and Formalism

Mathematics is used to:
- express constraints
- define bounds
- reveal impossibilities

Mathematics is **not** used to:
- obscure assumptions
- claim authority
- replace ontology

---

## Role of Computation

Computation is used to:
- test execution paths
- surface edge cases
- reveal brittleness
- detect drift

Computation does not define truth — it **exposes fragility**.

---

## Handling Uncertainty

Uncertainty is handled by:
- bounding (not averaging)
- worst-case feasibility
- stress-testing, not optimization

Unknowns are made explicit.

---

## Error, Drift, and Revision

This project assumes:
- error is inevitable
- drift is structural
- revision is mandatory

Revisions occur when:
- constraints change
- execution breaks
- memory reveals inconsistency

Revisions do **not**:
- rewrite history
- erase prior claims
- deny past failure

---

## Separation of Epistemic Roles

| Layer | Role |
|------|------|
| Science | What is true under constraint |
| Engineering | What can be built |
| Governance | What should be done |
| Execution | What is done |
| Memory | What happened |

Crossing roles produces epistemic corruption.

---

## AI and Epistemic Boundaries

AI systems:
- may assist analysis
- may surface patterns
- may test execution paths

AI systems may **not**:
- assert truth
- replace falsification
- override constraints
- become epistemic authorities

---

## Final Epistemic Commitment

This project commits to:

> **Truth bounded by feasibility, preserved by memory, and revised without denial.**

Anything that violates this is rejected — regardless of elegance or popularity.
