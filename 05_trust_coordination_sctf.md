# ARC 2 — Trust & Coordination  
## SCT-F: Structural Coordination under Trust Failure

---

## Why Trust Must Be Formalized

Most institutional theories treat trust as:
- cultural
- psychological
- moral
- interpersonal

This is insufficient.

> **Trust is a coordination primitive, not a virtue.**

Institutions exist because trust *cannot* be assumed at scale.

---

## The Core Problem

> **How do humans coordinate when trust is absent, partial, asymmetric, or strategically exploited?**

All institutions are answers to this question.

---

## Trust vs Coordination (Critical Distinction)

### Trust
- subjective
- belief-based
- non-verifiable
- fragile

### Coordination
- observable
- rule-bound
- enforceable
- durable

> **Institutions do not require trust.  
They require coordination mechanisms that function despite trust failure.**

---

## The Trust Illusion

Humans over-attribute success to trust because:
- trust feels personal
- trust is narratively convenient
- trust masks structural enforcement

In reality:
- trust follows coordination
- trust does not precede it

---

## Definition: SCT-F

> **SCT-F (Structural Coordination under Trust Failure)**  
> is the design space in which coordination remains possible even when trust degrades, is absent, or is adversarial.

SCT-F is not about increasing trust.  
It is about **removing trust as a dependency**.

**Energy Dependency (ARC-E):**  
Surplus, complexity cost, and trust in SCT-F correspond respectively to energy availability, energy dissipation, and energy transmission efficiency under constraint.


---

## Why SCT-F Is Necessary

At small scale:
- repeated interaction
- social sanction
- reputation

At large scale:
- anonymity
- power asymmetry
- misaligned incentives
- delayed feedback

Trust collapses beyond Dunbar-like limits.

Institutions exist because trust does not scale.

---

## Coordination Without Trust

Coordination is possible if:
- rules are explicit
- execution is constrained
- memory is durable
- outcomes are verifiable

These are **structural properties**, not moral ones.

---

## The Trust Failure Spectrum

Trust is not binary.

Institutions must function under:
1. Full trust (rare)
2. Partial trust (common)
3. Strategic mistrust
4. Adversarial behavior
5. Unknown actors

SCT-F assumes **worst-case trust conditions** by default.

---

## Why Trust-Based Institutions Fail

Institutions fail when they:
- rely on goodwill
- depend on discretion
- hide execution
- erase memory
- moralize compliance

These failures appear as:
- corruption
- capture
- arbitrariness
- legitimacy decay

But the root cause is **structural trust dependence**.

---

## Coordination Primitives (Preview)

SCT-F operates through:
- rule formalization
- execution separation
- evidence persistence
- verifiability
- bounded discretion

These will be formalized later (CI, SFEU, TDV).

---

## Trust as an Emergent Property

> **Trust is an outcome, not an input.**

When:
- coordination works
- outcomes are predictable
- enforcement is impartial
- memory is immutable

Trust emerges naturally.

Attempting to engineer trust directly always fails.

---

## The Key Inversion

Traditional framing:
> “How do we build trust so coordination works?”

SCT-F framing:
> **“How do we design coordination so trust is unnecessary?”**

This inversion is the foundation of Institution Substrate.

## Transition Within ARC 2

Next questions:
- What exactly is trust, ontologically?
- How does trust decay?
- How does coordination substitute for trust?
- How do institutions misprice trust?
